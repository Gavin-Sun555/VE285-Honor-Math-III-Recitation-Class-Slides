# Recitation Class Slides for Vv285 Honors Mathematics III
## Description
VV 285 is a second-semester math course for freshman student in [University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiao Tong University 
Joint Institute](http://umji.sjtu.edu.cn/). It mainly consists of elements of Linear Algebra and functions of several variables. In my sophomore year,
I worked as the teaching assistant for these courses, with the responsibility to conduct weekly recitation class, hold weekly
office hours, correct homework and exam papers. These are the slides I made for the recitation class. Due to the time limit (
I need to make one each week), the layout is not good and there may some mistakes with the slides. Extremely welcome to use the slides if you need and offer feedbacks regard them.
